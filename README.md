# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a website designed to help campers discover and explore new campgrounds.
The website allows users to view campgrounds that have been submitted by other users, complete with descriptions, photos, and location details.

Once logged in with their account, users can also leave comments and ratings for the campgrounds they have visited.
This feedback can be helpful for other users who are considering visiting the same campground in the future.
Additionally, users can create their own profiles, enabling them to save their favorite campgrounds and connect with other campers who share similar interests.

YelpCamp also offers a feature for users to submit their own campgrounds to the website. This enables other users to discover new and unique camping locations that they may not have otherwise known about.
The submission process is user-friendly and includes fields for campground details such as price to visit, detailed location, and images.

Overall, YelpCamp aims to make camping easier and more accessible for everyone by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for discovering and reviewing campgrounds. 
The website promotes community engagement and encourages campers to share their experiences with each other, ultimately leading to a more enjoyable and fulfilling camping experience for all.
